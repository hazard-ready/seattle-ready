Native stories also tell of a great earthquake (greater than magnitude 8) and tsunami that followed in 1700. Notable earthquakes include:</p><p>[2001] &#45 M6.8 Nisqually&#44; [1965] &#45 M6.5 Puget Sound&#44; [1949] &#45 M7.1 Puget Sound<br>Shaking for each of these earthquakes lasted between 30 to 45 seconds. Books and objects toppled off shelves. Brick buildings buckled and broke leaving piles of bricks and rubble on sidewalks and parked cars. Homes built on unstable soil became uninhabitable due to liquefaction. Costs totaled billions of dollars&#44; tens of lives&#44; and hundreds of injuries.</p><p>[1700] &#45 M8.9 to M9.2 Cascadia <br>The shaking lasted between three and five minutes and generated a 30 foot tsunami that hit the Washington coast and the natives living there&#44; <br> <q><i>In the days before the white man there was a great earthquake. It began about the middle of one night...and brought great masses of rock down from the mountains. One village was completely buried beneath a landslide. It was a very terrible experience; the people could neither stand nor sit for the extreme motion of the earth.</i></q><br>-Quote from Seismological Research Letters (<a href=http://oceanlink.island.net/SOLE/LP/FN/1700_tsunami.pdf target=_blank>Ludwin et. al&#44; 2005</a>),,,,,,,,,,,,,,What to Expect,In Your Lifetime,Flood_100yr_wUrban_kingco,Flood,1,100,,<p>There is a high chance of flooding here.

It is most common from November to February&#44; but can happen whenever the conditions are right.,,,,,,,What to Expect,In Your Lifetime,LSLD_Prone_kingco,Landslide,1,80,,This area is prone to landslides.  They tend to happen when the ground is wet from lots of rain or from ground shaking caused by earthquakes.What to Expect,In Your Lifetime,LSLD_Prone_kingco,Landslide,2,10,,This area has not been mapped as a landslide prone area. BUT if you live beneath a slope or drainage (where water concentrates) with little vegetation you could be at risk. Check points uphill to see if they have a higher chance for sliding.,,,,,,,What to Expect,What's the Worst?,LSLD_Prone_kingco,Landslide,1,90,,If slopes nearby are steep&#44; unvegitated&#44; and it's been raining for days a landslide may happen. Keep an eye out for unstable areas. Especially roads that have been blocked by fallen debris or washed out.What to Expect,What's the Worst?,LSLD_Prone_kingco,Landslide,2,30,,It's unlikely you will see a slide here&#44; but if slopes nearby are steep and conditions are right&#44; landslides can happen&#44; destroying property&#44; blocking roads and wreaking havoc.,,,,,,,What to Expect,Warning Signs,LSLD_kingco,Landslide,kingco,,,Do you hear sounds of cracking wood&#44; boulders knocking together&#44; the groaning of ground? Do you see cracks in the landscape and downslope movement of land&#44; rocks&#44; and vegetation? It could be a landslide. Move to stable ground.,,,,,,,How to Prepare,Before,LSLD_kingco,Landslide,kingco,,,<p>(1) ASSESS: If the area around your home may be prone to landslides seek advice of geotechnical experts. The can evaluate landslide hazard and/or design corrective techniques to reduce landslide risk.<br>(2) REDUCE RISK: Plant ground cover on slopes and/or build a retaining wall to stabilize hillsides<br> (3) PREPARE: Make a supply kit and family plan designating at least two evacuation routes</p>How to Prepare,During,LSLD_kingco,Landslide,kingco,,,<p>If you are&#44;<br><b>INDOORS</b> - STAY THERE! Drop&#44; cover&#44; and hold on to a sturdy piece of furniture.<br><b>OUTSIDE (near landslide)</b> - Get to the nearest high ground outside of the path of the landslide. Seek protection behind a group of trees or building.<br><b>OUTSIDE&#44; (in landslide path)</b> - If you can't escape&#44; curl into a tight ball and protect your head.</p>How to Prepare,After,LSLD_kingco,Landslide,kingco,,,<p>BE PREPARED FOR FLOODING (landslides often block rivers and can cause rivers to back up and flood).<ul><li> Stay away from the slide.
