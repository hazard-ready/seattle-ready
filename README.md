# seattle-ready
A disaster readiness website specific to the Seattle metro area.


The project is a custom instance of the [Disaster Preparedness](https://github.com/missoula-ready/disaster-preparedness) project, which is an adaptation of [a pioneering project from Oregon](https://github.com/Oregon-Public-Broadcasting/earthquake-preparedness) but has been generalized to make it easy to clone and tailor to other regions.

# To set it up, follow the instructions in the [Disaster Preparedness project README](https://github.com/missoula-ready/disaster-preparedness/blob/master/README.md).
