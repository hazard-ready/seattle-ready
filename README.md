# seattle-ready
A disaster readiness website specific to the Seattle metro area.


The project is a custom instance of the [Disaster Preparedness](https://github.com/missoula-ready/disaster-preparedness) project, which is an adaptation of [a pioneering project from Oregon](https://github.com/Oregon-Public-Broadcasting/earthquake-preparedness) but has been generalized to make it easy to clone and tailor to other regions.

# To set it up, follow the instructions in the [Disaster Preparedness project README](https://github.com/missoula-ready/disaster-preparedness/blob/master/README.md). But instead of DJANGO_SECRET_KEY, use DJANGO_SECRET_KEY_SEATTLE, and instead of DATABASE_URL, use DATABASE_URL_SEATTLE.

# This instance of Hazard Ready uses Webpack to bundle its static files. For that reason, you need these additional steps to set it up:
1. Make sure that you have [Node and NPM installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
1. In the same directory (```disasterinfosite```) that contains ```package.json```, run ```npm install```
1. Run ```npm run webpack```


Depending on your server setup, you may want to put these values in settings.py directly.

# Django language customization
Currently, there is no out-of-the box support for language codes cn (an abbreviated version of zh-hans, to make our URLs cleaner), and so (Somali). These instructions allow you to modfiy your Django installation to make it possible to navigate to /so/ and /cn/ to use this site in Somali and Chinese.

1. In ```venv/lib/python3.5/site-packages/django/conf/locale```, create a folder called `cn` and a folder called `so`
1. Copy the contents of the appropriate Chinese language folder into `cn` (curently, zh-Hans). This makes a Simplified Chinese language with the code `cn`.
1. Create a blank file called ``__init__.py`` in the `so` folder. In the `so` folder, create a folder named `LC_MESSAGES` and copy the file named `django.mo` from the equivalent location in any other language's folder. This sets up a dummy Somali translation, which is enough to fool Django into thinking it has a Somali version.

To finish adding languages, we have added `so` and `cn` to `django.conf.locale` in `settings.py`.

# Special data operations
There is one shapefile in disasterinfosite/data that is too big to host on github. It is called LSLD_steepslope.shp - so in this repo, it is LSLD_steepslope.shp.zip. Unzip it before doing a data add- and copy it to the reprojected folder if you don't have one, because that takes a long time.

# Values to put in Django Admin

### Tabs
Note: because this site is translated, you can find the translations for these values in ```admin-strings.xlsx```

###### Who Made This
`This is based on <a href="http://www.opb.org/news/widget/aftershock-find-your-cascadia-earthquake-story/" target="_blank">Aftershock</a>, an earthquake preparedness application for Oregon residents. Carson MacPherson-Krutsky and <a href="https://hs.umt.edu/geosciences/faculty/bendick/" target="_blank">Dr. Rebecca Bendick</a>, a graduate student and her advisor at the Unversity of Montana, had the idea to expand it for other locales and types of disasters. <a href="https://github.com/nein09" target="_blank">Melinda Minch</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eldang" target="_blank">Eldan Goldenberg</a> adapted it for that purpose. Source for a general-purpose version of this site is available on <a href="https://github.com/missoula-ready/disaster-preparedness" target="_blank">Github</a>.

###### Data Download
https://github.com/hazard-ready/seattle-ready/blob/master/disasterinfosite/data.zip

###### Past Events Photos
Upload photos to show in a photo gallery in the search results, under Past Events. Make sure that the heading you enter here matches the heading that the photos will appear under.

###### Data Overview Images
In the box at the bottom of every page, there's a section called 'Quick Data Overview'. That's where these will show up, as links that open in a new tab or window. The link_text field is what the link says, like 'Earthquakes: Distance from a Fault', and you can upload the appropriate image here.

### Deploying to the web via Apache
There are directories called 'photos' and 'data' in disasterinfosite/img. This is where images go when you upload them via Django Admin, under 'Photos of Past Events' and 'Data Overview Images'. In order for that upload to work, you need to change the owner (chown) those directories to whatever user Apache is running as (www-data, perhaps).
